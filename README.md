## Introduction

The Decentralized Research Paper Reproduction Platform is designed to address the challenges surrounding the reproducibility of research papers. It provides a decentralized approach, utilizing DOI to fetch research papers, and guides users through a six-stage reproduction process. By leveraging blockchain technology and other tools, the platform aims to improve the reproducibility and transparency of scientific research.

## Features

- **DOI Integration:** The platform uses Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) to fetch research papers for reproduction, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Six-Stage Reproduction Process:** The platform guides users through a comprehensive six-stage process for reproducing research papers, including data retrieval, methodology validation, code execution, result comparison, analysis, and report generation.
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is used to store research artifacts, ensuring their availability, permanence, and tamper resistance.
- **MetaMask Integration:** Users can connect their MetaMask wallets to interact with the platform and perform actions such as submitting reproduction reports and accessing rewards.
- **Web3.js and Ether.js:** The project integrates Web3.js and Ether.js libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts for reward distribution and platform governance.
- **React and Material-UI:** The frontend of the platform is built using React and Material-UI, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing the reproduction process.
- **Express.js and Node.js:** The backend of the platform is developed using Express.js and Node.js, enabling smooth data flow and server-side functionality.
- **Rainbowkit:** Rainbowkit is utilized to enhance the user interface with pre-built components and styles.

## Installation

To run the Decentralized Research Paper Reproduction Platform locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the required environment variables. You may need to create a `.env` file and provide the necessary values.
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the platform by visiting the provided URL. Make sure you have MetaMask installed and connected to the Ethereum network to fully utilize the platform's features. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the six-stage research paper reproduction process, fetch research papers using DOI, execute code, compare results, generate reports, and contribute to improving research reproducibility.
